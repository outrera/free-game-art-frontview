16 front-view "battlers", and 3 backgrounds for a simple 1 vs 1 turn-based combat system. These were all drawn by Hyptosis, most of them originally for SimpleQuest; a few of them were previously released. Released with permission.

All of the art uses Dawnbringer's 16-color palette. The scenes are vertical backgrounds, intended to fit the entire height and half the width of a 320x240 screen. The battlers are the same size, with transparent space around them to position them properly.
